# RocketShiel_Arduino
The RocketShield for the Arduino UNO designed to empower student to learn how to create their own PCB designs.  

It was made in colaboration with the Robotics and ilumination teachers from CENTRO. 

It is an example on how aa PCB can be part of the design of a product in both asthetics and engineering. 

The components need for the project are: 

    1 Push Button 
    2 5mm LEDs 
    4 3mm LEDs 
    6 220 Ohm resistors
    1 1k Ohm resistor
